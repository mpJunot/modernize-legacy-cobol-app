# Test Plan for COBOL Application

Initial conditions: when the program starts the in-memory balance is initialized to 1000.00.

| TC-1.1       | View Current Balance                           | Application started; initial balance = 1000.00 | 1. Start the application. 2. Select option 1 (View Balance).            | Displays the current balance (1000.00 if unchanged).                          |               |                    |          |
| TC-2.1       | Credit Account with Valid Amount               | Application started; current balance known | 1. Start the application. 2. Select option 2 (Credit). 3. Enter 100.00. | Balance increases by entered amount and new balance is displayed.             |               |                    |          |
| TC-2.2       | Credit Account with Zero Amount                | Application started; current balance known | 1. Start the application. 2. Select option 2. 3. Enter 0.00.            | Balance remains unchanged and displayed.                                      |               |                    |          |
| TC-2.3       | Credit Account with Negative / Invalid Input   | Application started                      | 1. Start the application. 2. Select option 2. 3. Enter "-50" or "abc".  | Application should either reject input or treat as invalid; balance unchanged; show error or reprompt. |               |                    | Validate COBOL ACCEPT behavior for non-numeric input. |
| TC-3.1       | Debit Account with Valid Amount                | Application started; current balance â‰¥ debit amount | 1. Start the application. 2. Select option 3 (Debit). 3. Enter 50.00.  | Balance decreases by entered amount and new balance is displayed.             |               |                    |          |
| TC-3.2       | Debit Account with Amount Greater Than Balance | Application started; current balance < entered amount | 1. Start app. 2. Select option 3. 3. Enter 2000.00 (or >balance).     | Display "Insufficient funds for this debit." Balance remains unchanged.       |               |                    |          |
| TC-3.3       | Debit Account with Zero Amount                 | Application started; current balance known | 1. Start the application. 2. Select option 3. 3. Enter 0.00.            | Balance remains unchanged and displayed.                                      |               |                    |          |
| TC-3.4       | Debit Account with Negative / Invalid Input    | Application started                      | 1. Start app. 2. Select option 3. 3. Enter "-30" or "xyz".              | Application should either reject input or treat as invalid; balance unchanged; show error or reprompt. |               |                    | Validate COBOL ACCEPT behavior for non-numeric input. |
| TC-4.1       | Exit the Application                           | Application started                      | 1. Start the application. 2. Select option 4 (Exit).                    | Application displays exit message and terminates.                             |               |                    |          |
| TC-5.1       | Invalid Menu Selection                         | Application started                      | 1. Start the application. 2. Enter a choice outside 1-4 (e.g., 9).      | Application displays "Invalid choice, please select 1-4." and reprompts.      |               |                    |          |
| TC-5.2       | Non-numeric Menu Input                         | Application started                      | 1. Start the application. 2. At menu enter "a" or other non-numeric.    | Application behavior depends on ACCEPT handling; expect rejection or error message and reprompt. |               |                    | Validate COBOL ACCEPT for numeric choice. |
| TC-6.1       | Multiple Sequential Operations                 | Application started                      | 1. Start app. 2. Credit 200.00. 3. Debit 50.00. 4. View Balance.        | Balance reflects both operations in order (initial +200 -50).                |               |                    | Exercises DataProgram READ/WRITE persistence within run. |
| TC-6.2       | Persistence Across Calls Within One Run        | Application started                      | 1. Start app. 2. Credit 100.00. 3. Call View Balance.                  | View shows updated balance (DataProgram WRITE updated STORAGE-BALANCE).       |               |                    | STORAGE-BALANCE persists while process runs. |

## Guidance for validation
- Leave "Actual Result" and "Status" blank for stakeholder validation.
- Note that COBOL ACCEPT behavior for non-numeric input and negative handling depends on runtime and platform; include these cases to confirm expected handling before automation.
- Use the initial balance of 1000.00 as the canonical starting state for all test runs unless stakeholders request a different baseline.
